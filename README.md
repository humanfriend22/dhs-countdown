# DUSD Countdown

A simple countdown for the end of the period and the school day using the DUSD bell schedule. Production build (download to phone as a PWA): https://65c44fa6a6d4df26e2d04e2d--voluble-kashata-1394d3.netlify.app/

> The schedule is hard coded in `src/schedules.js`. I took a screenshot of the schedule and used Google Bard to extract the data
